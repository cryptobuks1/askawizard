<p><h1>Ask A Wizard</h1>

<p>The Bitcoin project is experiencing unprecedented growth. With so many new people it is important for them to correctly understand what Bitcoin is, how it works and what they need to do to keep their funds safe.
<p>Additionally, there is a lot of misinformation or otherwise unhelpful noise and babble in the public sphere.
<p>Therefore, it is important the competent and reputable people be engaged in this teaching and training.
<p>The goal of the Ask A Wizard is to increase the educational resources about how Bitcoin works and who makes it possible by adding a regular segment of Ask A Wizard to the <a href="http://www.bitcoin.kn">Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast</a> which is the #2 Bitcoin related audio audience with tens of thousands of downloads per episode.

<p>What would be appreciated is for all Bitcoin Core contributors who want to participate to (1) come up with a question or choose one from below, (2) record the answer [ideally between 5-15 minutes] and (3) notify via a pull request which includes the .mp3 in the mp3 folder and attach the mp3.
<p>Below are a significant number of questions to spark your creativity.
<p>Please, do not worry about 'dumbing down' the question, etc. since the podcast audience is composed of the newest potential user to some of the most veteran contributors. Just be yourself and answer the question in a factually correct way.

<p>When recording the mp3, preferably with a good microphone for high quality audio, then this format will be good for organization.

<p><b>Introduction</b> – it would be good to state name, why you work on Bitcoin Core and a few of the major contributions you have made to Bitcoin Core [15-45 seconds].
<p><b>Question</b> – Succinctly phrase the question [You can find 100+ questions below]. [5-20 seconds]
<p><b>Answer</b> – Provide the planned and organized answer. [5-15 minutes]
<p><b>Conclusion</b> – it would be good to include where people can find more from you [website, Twitter, etc.] [5-15 seconds]

<p>Segments will be polished and distributed through a wide variety of channels to get as much impact as possible.
<p>Your contributions will be greatly force multiplied to be useful and helpful for users and the Bitcoin Core project.
<p>Thank you!

<p><b>QUESITONS</b>

<p>These are some suggested questions. The audience will be people interested in Bitcoin and blockcahin but they might be developers, lawyers, bankers, etc. The goal is to have widely applicable easy questions/answers but also very hard and technical questions/answers with everything in between.

<p>If you want to do a particular question then feel free to put your name and date of claim next to it so others know you are working on it. There will not be really be any problem with multiple people doing the same question since new episodes will hopefully be published on a weekly schedule.

<p>Examples:
<p>Jonas Schnelli – Explains <a href="http://www.bitcoin.kn/2016/04/bitcoin-core-developer-jonas-schnelli-explains-hierarchical-deterministic-key-generation/">hierarchical deterministic key generation</a>.
<p>Eric Lombrozo – <a href="http://www.bitcoin.kn/2016/04/ciphrex-ceo-eric-lombrozo-contrasts-hard-soft-forks/">Contrasts hard and soft forks</a>

<p>Thanks so much for your help educating the general public about this area of technology.
